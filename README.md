Predictive modeling

The fierce competition in the telecommunications industry makes it difficult to have loyal customers stay in a particular company for a long time. Customers are looking for better services with lower costs and if they are not stuck in a contract can easily switch to another company. This issue is one of the main reasons that the churn rate is normally high in the industry. As data analysts, we are trying to review the customersâ€™ data and create a model based on the trend and different metrics to predict how long a customer will stay with the company and then be prepared to try to change their mind with different actions.
